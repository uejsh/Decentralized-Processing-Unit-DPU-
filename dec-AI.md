# ⚙️ Decentralized AI Network — Task-Based Consensus System

### 💡 Overview
This project demonstrates a **decentralized AI network** where contributors collaboratively generate, refine, and share embeddings and transformation matrices using **task-based consensus and tokenized incentives**. The system allows emergent intelligence to arise from distributed computation and coordinated aggregation.  

Beyond AI, the framework can be applied to any **distributed computation or consensus-driven data aggregation system**.

### 🛠 How It Works

1. **Task Creation and Rewards**  
   - Anyone can create a task and assign a reward.  
   - Each participant receives a **fixed base reward**, which increases proportionally with the number of participants committing to the task.  

2. **Commitment of Embeddings and Matrices**  
   - Participants submit embeddings or transformation matrices for the task.  
   - The **majority embeddings/matrices are stored**, establishing the “winning” contribution.  

3. **Ownership and Exchange**  
   - Contributors who commit the winning embeddings/matrices gain **ownership shares**.  
   - In exchange, participants receive embeddings/matrices from winners of other tasks, enabling **cross-task knowledge transfer**.  

4. **Global Aggregation**  
   - Using a predefined aggregation algorithm, all local embeddings and matrices are combined into a **globally coherent AI state**.  

5. **Distributed Inference**  
   - During inference, rows of transformation matrices are assigned to **different nodes or clusters**.  
   - Each node performs its local transformation, then commits results to a new consensus task.  
   - Majority consensus determines the winning local outputs, and contributors gain ownership of these matrix shares.  

6. **Final Output**  
   - Aggregated local results are combined for each token to generate a **coherent AI response**.  
   - Winning contributors also receive **access to the AI** in proportion to their contributions.
