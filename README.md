**Flow-Powered Decentralized Computation Network**  

The **Decentralized Processing Unit (DPU)** is a **Flow-based, trustless, auction-driven computing network**. Users submit computational tasks as **on-chain resources**, nodes execute them **off-chain**, submit **verifiable proofs of execution**, and get rewarded. With **partial execution**, **auction-based handoff**, and **proof-of-function verification**, DPU redefines decentralized computation.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📌 Task as Resources:** Cadence resources ensure tasks are **immutable, secure, and verifiable**.  
- **⏱ Partial Execution & Handoff:** Nodes run tasks as much as they want, then **freeze & auction to the next node**.  
- **🔐 Proof-of-Function (PoF):** Every function generates a **hash proof**, verified on-chain before payment.  
- **💰 Auction-Based Incentives:** Competitive bidding assigns tasks efficiently, rewarding nodes fairly.  
- **⚡ Off-Chain Execution, On-Chain Verification:** Heavy computation runs off-chain while verification and rewards remain **trustless and transparent**.

## 🏗 Architecture

1. **User submits task** → creates a `Task` resource with code snippet or reference.  
2. **Task stored on-chain** → secured in **TaskManager contract**.  
3. **Nodes execute task** → off-chain computation in Python/JS/etc.  
4. **Hash proof submitted** → verified by **verification nodes**.  
5. **Rewards released** → on successful verification.  
6. **Partial task handoff** → auction continues to the next node.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Flow Blockchain & Cadence**: Resource-oriented smart contracts, atomic transactions  
- **Off-Chain Execution**: Python, JavaScript, or any language  
- **IPFS / External Links**: Optional storage for large task code

## 💡 Why DPU?

DPU demonstrates a **trustless, verifiable, scalable approach to decentralized computation**, leveraging Flow’s unique features:  
- Resource-oriented assets 🔒  
- Composable workflows 🧩  
- Atomic transactions ⚡  

It’s essentially a **Flow-native evolution of Golem**, designed to **wow judges and hackathons**.
