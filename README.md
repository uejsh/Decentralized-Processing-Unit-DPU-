# ⚙️ HashLayer — The Compute Consensus Layer

### 🧠 Turning computation into an ownable, tradable, and rewardable digital resource.

---

## 🚀 Vision

**HashLayer** is the foundation for a **decentralized compute consensus system** — where the most effective process to transform a task into an output becomes a *shared, ownable digital asset*.

Nodes commit candidate computation strategies (expressed as hashed matrices).  
A majority consensus selects the most efficient or correct result.  
The **winning computation**, represented by its hash, becomes a reusable building block.  
Each time it’s reused, its owners automatically receive Flow token royalties via **Flow Actions**.

> 💡 In essence: HashLayer transforms computation from an ephemeral process into a modular, monetizable resource.

## 🧩 Core Idea

1. **Task Commitment**  
   Nodes receive a task → compute a result → commit the hash of their computation matrix.

2. **Consensus & Selection**  
   Majority agreement determines the most effective (or correct) matrix transformation.

3. **Ownership & Rewarding**  
   The winning nodes receive ownership shares of that matrix hash.

4. **Usage & Royalties (via Flow Actions)**  
   Whenever that matrix (computation method) is reused by others, Flow Actions trigger automatic royalty payments to the owners.

## ⚙️ Why It Matters

- **Parallelizable:** Tasks are decomposed into matrix segments computed by different nodes.  
- **Modular:** Reusable “computation blueprints” can be combined to form larger tasks.  
- **Ownable:** Each effective process or transformation can be tokenized and reused like intellectual property.  
- **Scalable:** Ideal for AI training, gaming, or any domain requiring distributed computation.  
- **Incentivized:** Contributors are rewarded instantly for computational innovation and efficiency.

## 🔗 Built on Flow

Flow’s **resource-oriented model** and **Actions framework** make it the perfect chain for this system:
- Resources model ownership of computation structures.
- Actions enable atomic royalty payments for reuse.
- FlowToken + FungibleToken standards handle distributed incentives.
